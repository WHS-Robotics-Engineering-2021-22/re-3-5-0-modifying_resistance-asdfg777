Circuit 1, the current is divided allowing for two seperate speeds of current, (15.15mA),(10.64mA), to reach two seperate grounds. The reason for doing this would be if you wanted the current slowed down but did not care too much about the level of resistance.


Circuit 2, by putting resistors in series the resistance is added up slowing down the current. (6.25mA)


Circuit 3, the current is divided slowing it down, but is rejoined before reaching ground causing it to speed back up for the final stretch. Ending current 25.79mA
